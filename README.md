# AOEFxProject

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

# Overview

The game that I've made is a basic sandbox shooter based off of Unreal Engine's Third Person game template. The game has a single character controlled by the user, and comes with basic movement controls: walking, turning and jumping. There are also additional controls that allows the user to switch between the default third person perspective to a first person perspective view, and the ability to spawn and launch a projectile in front of the player.  
The purpose for writing this game comes down to two central ideas: learning the fundamentals of working with Unreal Engine blueprints, and event handling with multiview perspectives.
